# Skill harvest log

## 2026-09-29 â€” WIN-MPRE8VI4U6U airc/bob/jeeves cutover

Harvested into `.grok/skills/bobiverse-{jeeves,bob,airc}` + `docs/post-install.md` + install scripts:

| Lesson | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| `Start-Jeeves` / `--channel` + PowerShell `#` comment | `irc_agent.py`: `--channel` optional when `--chair` |
| MSI LocalSystem ChairHome â†’ `C:\Users\Default\â€¦` | `Install-Jeeves`: prefer Admin chair or `home-jeeves` |
| Legacy `BobJeeves` + `ircJeeves` both Running | `Disable-BobiverseLegacyBobJeeves` on install |
| `CryptUnprotectData` with LocalSystem + Admin identity | post-install + skill: ObjectName / park identity interim |
| Crash-loop stderr flooding airc console | NSSM AppStdout/AppStderr â†’ `C:\ai\jeeves\logs\` |
| Leftover `AircConsole` beside bobiverse `Airc` | `Install-Airc` **removes** `AircConsole` from SCM |
| Legacy `BobJeeves` left Stopped/Disabled in services.msc | `Remove-BobiverseLegacyService` deletes SCM entry (tree kept) |
| Remote ops via bob outbox PRIVMSG to `*_console` | bobiverse-bob / bobiverse-airc skills |
| Duplicate MSI tray vs Watch-BobTray | already 0.1.5 (#14); documented again |

VERSION â†’ **0.1.6** (pack when shipping).

## 2026-09-30 â€” DEV1 TipForm companion durable start

Harvested into .grok/skills/bobiverse-bob + docs/post-install.md + tray launcher:

| Lesson | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| Tray logs `tray up` then dies when started from Grok agent shell | `Start-BobFleetTray` uses WMI `Win32_Process.Create` (job-object breakaway) |
| Broad seat-wrapper `match Watch-BobTray` kills diagnosing shells | Kill filter requires `-File â€¦Watch-BobTray.ps1` / `_Watch-BobTray-*.ps1` |
| Product is service + companion, not BobFleet task | HKCU `Run\BobiverseTray`; disable `BobFleet-<id>` |
| LocalSystem skipped update-check | `Start-Bob` no longer forces `BOBIVERSE_NO_UPDATE`; `Check-BobiverseUpdate` resolves `gh` + Releases API |
| TipForm recycle JIT `PipelineStoppedException` | CatchException before Controls; swallow on ticks (agentic_build Watch-BobTray) |
| Version visible on card | TipForm footer `bob {ver}` |

VERSION â†’ **0.1.8** (pack when shipping).

## 2026-09-30 â€” Jeeves webhooks + digest roster + start ff-only (0.1.9)

| Lesson | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| Digest machines must be ChanServ shops only | `bobreport` roster gate + prune unregistered; period roll replaces lesser pcent |
| Intake/jira on ionos | `bobcallback` `/bob/v1/intake` + `/bob/v1/jira`; durable `webhook_queue`; announce `#bobiverse` |
| Harvest without GitHub | shared `.grok/skills/harvest` in every MSI; intake `kind` default `issue` |
| Product MSI books split | Pack stages per-product docs/skills/AGENTS; jeeves has no bob seat/TipForm |
| Start-time update | `Sync-BobiverseFromRepo` ff-only clone â†’ sync install tree; MSI update is fallback |
| Install start failures | `Report-BobiverseIntakeIssue` from Install-Jeeves/Bob/Airc |

VERSION â†’ **0.1.9**.
## 2026-09-30 — TipForm Restart→ircBob; tray never Sync/ff (0.1.10)

| Lesson | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| Tray + service both looked like updaters | Tray Start skips product update; Sync/ff only on Start-Bob |
| TipForm Restart only relaunched UI | Restart ircBob → Restart-BobEar then Start-BobTray |
| Quiet MSI TipForm in session 0 (invisible) | Start-BobTrayInteractive ONLOGON /IT; no session-0 Start-Process |
| Jeeves missing from #win-mpre… | ChanServ !register required for chair_channels |

VERSION → **0.1.10**.

## 2026-10-02 - chair commands, Start Menu, agent-start layer (PR #83)

| Lesson | Fix |
|---|---|
| `+h` re-granted every 30-60 s | Not a ChanServ fight: the ear was killed by the watcher (no `--host` on its command line) and rejoined. Service now bakes `-IrcHost`; chan_privs hard cap 3 grants / 10 min |
| `!recycle` had no authorization | `chair_commands.py` owner/ear auth, 120 s cooldown, `dry-run` |
| Start Menu had scattered duplicates | One `Programs\Bobiverse` folder, `Install-BobiverseStartMenu` dedupes, systray icon everywhere |
| ergo.exe hardlink broken by upgrade (#70) | Component Permanent+NeverOverwrite, `Repair-BobiverseErgoHardlink` |
| Agents did not know to file what they learned | CAST IRON RULE in AGENTS/skills, `Invoke-BobiverseHarvest.ps1` |
